DS Game Maker Library (dsgmLib)
===============================
dsgmLib is an object-orientated C library for Nintendo DS game development. Although it's designed specifically for [DS Game Maker](https://github.com/DSGameMaker/dsgmApp) (which generates dsgmLib code files), it's ideal for general Nintendo DS homebrew games as well.

In particular dsgmLib is a successor to [PAlib](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pands/) and an alternative to [NightFoxâ€™s Lib](http://www.nightfoxandco.com/index.php/main-en/coding/nfl-en/).

### What it does

Nintendo DS games are generally written in C, but C isn't a language which directly supports object-orientated programming. dsgmLib provides an object-orientated layer for game development, allowing you to write clean, modular code whilst avoiding [God objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object).

DS Game Maker generates dsgmLib code like this:

    void ball_touch(ballObjectInstance *me) {
        me->x += 32;
        me->y += 32;
    }

It's clear that when any instance of `ball` is touched, it is moved down and right by 32 pixels.

Importantly we didn't have to rely on the sprite number of our object instance to update its position - this would be ugly, and it's how older versions of DS Game Maker worked:

    DSGM_SetSpriteXY(
        me->screen,
        me->spriteNumber,
        DSGM_GetSpriteX(me->screen, me->spriteNumber) + 32,
        DSGM_GetSpriteY(me->screen, me->spriteNumber) + 32
    );

Dealing with sprite numbers directly is clunky; the end user shouldn't have to do this. A key feature (or principle) of dsgmLib is providing an abstraction from the OAM (Object Attribute Memory). You don't have to care about sprite numbers or rotation sets - only object instances (which could have any sprite numbers). We've designed this abstraction to make common tasks such as moving a sprite (object instance) as easy as possible.

dsgmLib is feature rich. It supports: high level object oriented programming, wireless DS to DS multiplayer (NiFi), saving and loading, 3D (support for MD2 models with animation and texturing, as well as abstractions for complex 3D math such as quaternions), drawable backgrounds, rotatable and scalable backgrounds, custom fonts, scaling and rotating of sprites, sound effects, and music.

### As a PAlib Replacement

PAlib is ridiculously old - it was last updated in 2008 - and bloated (it includes things which DS Game Maker has never used such as Mode 7 3D). PAlib also requires an old or modified version of the devkitARM toolchain. As a result, PAlib is very difficult to maintain and a replacement is long over due.

devkitARM Installation
-------------

You will need the [devkitARM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/) toolchain from the vendor [devkitPro](http://devkitpro.org/). You can read the instructions from the [devkitPro wiki](http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM) in full or get going right away as follows.

### Windows
Download and run [devkitProUpdater-1.5.3.exe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/Automated%20Installer/devkitProUpdater-1.5.3.exe/download). Only "Minimal System" and "devkitARM" are required; install devkitPPC and devkitPSP only if you want to develop for the Nintendo Wii/Sony PSP respectively. Log out and log in again if there are compilation problems.

### OS X, Linux, etc.
Download [devkitARMupdate.pl](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/Automated%20Installer/devkitARMupdate.pl/download) to your home directory (`/Users/(username)` on OS X or `/home/(username)` on Ubuntu); it's a Perl script. Open a terminal and run this:

    cd ~
    perl devkitARMupdate.pl
    export DEVKITPRO=~/devkitPro
    export DEVKITARM=~/devkitPro/devkitARM

Great! We're done.

Getting Started
---------------
[Download dsgmLib](https://github.com/DSGameMaker/dsgmLib/archive/master.zip), and extract the archive to your devkitPro directory (for example `C:\devkitPro`), then rename the directory from `dsgmLib-master` to `dsgmLib`.

Additionally, dsgmLib requires a fork of dswifi called dsgmDSWiFi which enables support for local DS to DS multiplayer (NiFi). Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/DSGameMaker/dsgmDSWiFi/releases). Extract the files in `include` to your libnds `include` directory (for example `C:\devkitPro\libnds\include`) and the files in `lib` to your libnds `lib` directory (for example `C:\devkitPro\libnds\lib\`).

Now open a terminal in the dsgmLib directory. Run `ls` to (hopefully) print this list of files and directories:

    examples
    include
    lib
    source
    template
    LICENSE
    Makefile
    README.md

`cd` to `examples` and run `ls` to list the examples:

    Basic3D
    Collision
    CustomFont
    DrawableBackground
	FruitNinja
    LargeBackground
    MarioKart
	MD2
    NiFi
    RoomPersistency
    RotationBackground
    TopDownShooter
    Priority
    RotsetEffects
    Saving
    Unpossible
    Worms
    Makefile

Let's compile the `Collision` example.

`cd` to `Collision` and run `make`:

    cd Collision
    make

You'll see `Collision.nds` is generated which you can run with an emulator like [NO$GBA](http://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm) (for Windows) or [DeSmuME](http://desmume.org/download/) (for Windows/OS X/Linux).

Additionally, you can compile all of the examples at once by running `make` on the `examples` directory.

Recompiling the Library
---------
If you make changes to the library's source code (dsgmLib directory), you'll need to recompile it by running `make` in the directory. Now recompile any projects that link against the library.

FAQs
---------
###Compile error of "cannot find -ldsgmdswifi9"
This is occurs when dsgmDSWiFi has not been installed. Download [dsgmDSWiFi](https://github.com/DSGameMaker/dsgmDSWiFi/releases) and extract the lib and include files to your libnds paths (for example `C:\devkitPro\libnds\lib` and `C:\devkitPro\libnds\include`).

###Game works fine in the emulator but when playing on a DS with a flashcard there is just a black screen
DS Game Maker uses `NitroFS`, a method of loading data (sprites, backgrounds, music, etc...) for homebrew games from inside of the compiled .nds file. Unfortunately, many flashcards are designed soley for running pirated games and do not support this homebrew feature. Either you can make your game without using NitroFS (store files in RAM instead), or you can use the [Homebrew Menu](http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Homebrew_Menu) (which supports NitroFS) on your flashcard.
